A Django-Python application to manage hard-copy comic books

= Introduction =

I recently got into comics and as a burgeonin pythonista, I decided to put together a django-python app to keep track of all of the comics I've bought, the comics I've subscribed too, and the comics I want.

As I mentioned, I am learning django, but "think" I know Python. If you see any suggestions in the source code, please let me know. Also, if you have any suggestions for how I can extend the app, I'll entertain those as well.
